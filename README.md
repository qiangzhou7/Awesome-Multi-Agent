# 🤖🤝 Awesome Multi-Agent with LLMs

> _“One LLM is smart. A swarm of them? That’s a society.”_  
> A curated list of awesome projects, papers, demos, and resources at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Multi-Agent Systems**.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

LLMs can do a lot on their own — but things get *really interesting* when they start talking to each other.  
This repo explores the wild, weird, and wonderful world of **multi-agent systems** powered by LLMs:  
agents that chat, collaborate, deceive, plan, negotiate, build, and maybe... start a company?

If you’re into:
- 🤹 Emergent behavior from LLM agents  
- 🧠 Cognitive architectures in agent societies  
- 📦 Agents that plan, act, and revise  
- 🌍 Simulated economies, governments, classrooms, or adventuring parties...

You're in the right place.
