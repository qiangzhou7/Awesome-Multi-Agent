# 🤖🤝 Awesome Multi-Agent with LLMs

> _“One LLM is smart. A swarm of them? That’s a society.”_  
> A curated list of awesome projects, papers, demos, and resources at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Multi-Agent Systems**.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

LLMs can do a lot on their own — but things get *really interesting* when they start talking to each other.  
This repo explores the wild, weird, and wonderful world of **multi-agent systems** powered by LLMs:  
agents that chat, collaborate, deceive, plan, negotiate, build, and maybe... start a company?

If you’re into:
- 🤹 Emergent behavior from LLM agents  
- 🧠 Cognitive architectures in agent societies  
- 📦 Agents that plan, act, and revise  
- 🌍 Simulated economies, governments, classrooms, or adventuring parties...

You're in the right place.

## 🧭 Directory

### 📜 1. Research Papers
> Where science meets social simulations.

> Multi-Agent Efficiency

- **Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies**, 2025.02, [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02533)
- **AgentDropout: Dynamic Agent Elimination for Token-Efficient and High-Performance LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration**, 2025.03, [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18891)
- **Cut the Crap: An Economical Communication Pipeline for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems**, 2024.10, [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02506)
- **A Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network for Task-Oriented Agent Collaboration**，2024.11, [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02170)


### 🧪 2. Benchmarks & Simulations
> Testbeds for chaos (or order).

- Code Generation(CG)
  - **HumanEval benchmark**: 64 human-labeled function-level completion codes and unit tests.
- Decision Making(DM)
  - **WebShop**: WebShop requires to find the item given an instruction of the customer provides “reward” as an intrinsic metric for item-instruction relevance, and “success” is marked when the reward is 1.0.
- General Reasoning(GR) 
  - **MMLU Dataset**: Four categories of a vast amount of problems in 57 subjects.
- Arithmetic Reasoning(AR)
  - **MATH**: 7 subareas and 5,000 questions.

### 🛠️ 3. Frameworks & Toolkits
> Build your own agent society.

- 🏗️ Multi-agent orchestration libraries (AutoGen, CAMEL, ChatDev, etc.)  
- 🎛️ Planning frameworks and tool-assisted action loops  
- 💬 Multi-agent chatroom & simulation engines  
- 🧠 Tools for memory, persona, and world state modeling

### 🎮 4. Demos & Cool Projects
> Agents gone wild.

- 🎲 Simulated societies with emergent behavior  
- 🧬 Scientific experiments in self-organization and adaptation  
- 🧑‍💼 Multi-agent startups & autonomous business systems  
- 👾 Games with LLM-powered NPCs and parties  

### 🧠 5. Theory & Concepts
> Minds, motives, and models.

- 🧭 Agent modeling & decision theory  
- 🎭 Role assignment, identity, and social cognition  
- ⚖️ Negotiation, deception, and moral reasoning  
- 🧠 Group dynamics & distributed cognition  
- 📚 Learning from interaction and memory traces

### 🚀 6. Open Questions & Speculative Directions
> The fun stuff.

- 🪐 Can LLM agents form cultures or traditions?  
- 🤔 What does it mean for agents to "understand" each other?  
- 🧯 Can emergent behavior be guided… or should it?  
- 📽️ When will the LLM Agent Reality Show air?
